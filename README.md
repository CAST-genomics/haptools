Haptools is a collection of tools for simulating and analyzing genotypes and phenotypes while taking into account haplotype information. Haptools supports fast simulation of admixed genomes (with `simgenotype`), visualization of admixture tracks (with `karyogram`), simulating haplotype- and local ancestry-specific phenotype effects (with `transform` and `simphenotype`), and computing a variety of common file operations and statistics in a haplotype-aware manner.

# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.
# Every config option has reasonable defaults unless it is labeled as "required."
# All paths are relative to the directory that Snakemake is executed in.
# Note: this file is written in the YAML syntax (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)


# Paths to VCFs for SNPs in 1000G
# If the VCFs are per-chromosome, replace the contig name in the file name with "{chr}"
# required!
snp_vcf: "/projects/ps-gymreklab/resources/datasets/1000Genomes/phase3VCFs/ALL.{chr}.phase3_shapeit2_mvncall_integrated_v5a.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz"

# Path to a 1000G samples TSV file
# You can get this file by clicking "Download the list" here:
# https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample
# required!
samples: data/igsr_samples.tsv

# Which 1000G superpopulation should be used?
# Please provide a three letter code, corresponding to the symbol in the samples file
# This will default to EUR (aka european ancestry), if not specified
superpop: EUR

# Discard rare SNPs with a MAF below this number
# Defaults to 0 if not specified
min_maf: 0.1

# Whether to use development mode
# This will cause the pipeline to ignore all but chr22
develop: true

# Path to the directory in which to store all output of the pipeline
# Defaults to "out" if not specified
out: out

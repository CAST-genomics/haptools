# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.
# Every config option has reasonable defaults unless it is labeled as "required."
# All paths are relative to the directory that Snakemake is executed in.
# Note: this file is written in the YAML syntax (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)


# Paths to a SNP-STR haplotype reference panel for 1000G
# You can download this from http://gymreklab.com/2018/03/05/snpstr_imputation.html
# If the VCFs are per-chromosome, replace the contig name in the file name with "{chr}"
# The VCF(s) must be sorted and indexed (with a .tbi file in the same directory)
# required!

# Path to a 1000G samples TSV file
# You can get this file by clicking "Download the list" here:

# A list of loci, specifying variants to use within the simulations
# Each locus can be specified as a dict composed of two keys:
# 1. "locus" - a string with a contig name, a colon, the start position, a dash, and the
# end position
# 2. "str" - a string with a contig name, a colon, and the start position
# The STR position should be containinged within the locus.
# The positions should be provided in the same coordinate system as the reference
# genome of the VCF files.
# The contig should correspond with the contig name from the {chr} wildcard in the VCF
# required!
loci:
  - locus: 1:98001984-99001984
    str: 1:98506615
  # - 1:10177-1010177

# Which 1000G superpopulation should be used?
# Please provide a three letter code, corresponding to the symbol in the samples file
# This will default to EUR (aka european ancestry), if not specified
superpop: EUR

# Discard rare variants with a MAF below this number
# Defaults to 0 if not specified
min_maf: 0

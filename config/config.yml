# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.
# Every config option has reasonable defaults unless it is labeled as "required."
# All paths are relative to the directory that Snakemake is executed in.
# Note: this file is written in the YAML syntax (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)


# Paths to VCFs for SNPs in 1000G

# A list of loci, specifying SNPs to use within the simulations
# Each locus can be specified as a string composed of a contig name, a colon, the start
# position, a dash, and the end position.
# The positions should be provided in the same coordinate system as the reference
# genome of the VCF files.
# THe contig should correspond with the contig name from the {chr} wildcard in the VCF
# required!
loci:
  - 1:98001984-99001984
  # - 1:10177-1010177

# Which 1000G superpopulation should be used?
# Please provide a three letter code, corresponding to the symbol in the samples file
# This will default to EUR (aka european ancestry), if not specified
superpop: EUR

# Discard rare SNPs with a MAF below this number
# Defaults to 0 if not specified
min_maf: 0.05

# Path to the directory in which to store all output of the pipeline
# Defaults to "out" if not specified
out: out
